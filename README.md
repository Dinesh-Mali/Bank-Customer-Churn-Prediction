# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Bank Customer Churn Prediction using H2O AutoML.

# Introduction
Main Aim of this project is to predict whether a person will leave the bank services, i.e., He/She will churn or not 
using ML and Auto ML technique.

# H2O AutoML
This is fully open-sourced, distributed in-memory machine learning platform with linear scalability. H2O supports the most widely used statistical
and machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosted machines, geberalized linear models, deep learning, and many more.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
